Hello {{ job.company.get_full_name }},

This is a friendly reminder that your job listing "{{ job.title }}" is about to expire.

{% if days_left > 0 %}
Time Remaining: {{ days_left }} day{{ days_left|pluralize }} and {{ hours_left }} hour{{ hours_left|pluralize }}
{% else %}
Time Remaining: {{ hours_left }} hour{{ hours_left|pluralize }}
{% endif %}
Expiration Date: {{ expiration_date|date:"F j, Y g:i A" }}

Once the job listing expires, it will no longer be visible to job seekers and will be marked as "Expired" in your dashboard.

If you'd like to extend the application deadline, you can do so from your employer dashboard:
{{ dashboard_url }}

Or you can directly view and edit this job listing:
{{ job_url }}
