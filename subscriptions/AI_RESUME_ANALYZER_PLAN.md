# Comprehensive AI Features Implementation Plan

## Problem Statement

The current "AI" functionality in SearchFind is entirely simulated:
- It doesn't actually analyze uploaded files (resumes, cover letters, etc.)
- It returns random scores and generic suggestions
- It can't distinguish between valid and invalid document types
- Users receive the same analysis results regardless of file content
- Employers don't get meaningful AI assistance for job postings or candidate matching
- Pro users aren't receiving the value they're paying for

This creates a poor user experience for paying customers who expect genuine AI analysis and assistance.

## Proposed Solution

Implement a comprehensive AI system using document parsing and rule-based NLP techniques without requiring expensive external APIs. This approach will:

1. Extract text from uploaded documents (PDF, DOCX, TXT)
2. Validate document types and content
3. Parse and analyze various document types (resumes, cover letters, job descriptions)
4. Generate meaningful scores and personalized suggestions
5. Provide AI assistance for both job seekers and employers
